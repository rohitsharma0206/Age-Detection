# Age-Detection
A Convolutional Neural Network model trained to predict age group (Young, Middle, Old) from images.

Dataset Description :
Datasets contains 19906 images of Indian celebrities labeled in 3 classes (Young, Middle, Old) according to their ages. Most of the images are blurry and are of different angles.

Model Description :
Keeping, the computational power of my personal computer, in mind. I have used a simple Convolutional Neural Network model with just 4 hidden layers (counting convolutional and pooling layer as 1).
